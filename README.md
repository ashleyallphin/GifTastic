### Functionality

When the user clicks on a keyword button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated GIF images from the GIPHY API on the button's topic and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the GIF will animate. If the user clicks the GIF again, it will stop playing.

Each GIF is displayed with its title and rating.  The user may clear the GIFs with the Empty Results button.

The user may add their own keyword buttons by submitting a value in the user input box. 

The app is fully mobile responsive.

Users may add their favorite GIFs to a `favorites` section.  The user may clear their favorites by clicking the Empty Favorites button.


### Resources and Credits
This page was created with the Bootstrap framework and uses GIPHY API.
